1.1
- milter_env_addr_mangle:
    - changed the merging algorithm: actions don't change data directly. they add changes to the special list instead.
      this list is processed in the end after all actions so the changes made by one action will not be discarded by
      another one.

1.0
- milter_env_addr_mangle:
    - added application (py), sample config (yml), Debian init scrips (sh)
- added CircleCI config
- added this (changelog.txt) file
